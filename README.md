BetPublisher

this service simulates a bet booking houses updating the game odds
it updates odds every 5 seconds
this service uses an AMQP exchange to publish new odds for a game. Upon a failure on the exchange it will fallback to a legacy Rest service to update the odds via POST
This fallback is done using resillience4j circuitBreaker

BetBulletinService

This service allow for the query of games, booking bet odds and updating booker bet odds for a game.

This service allows for the publishing of new Odds via AMQP or Rest.

To test this stop the docker container and you will see trying to post via rest instead.
If you deploy the container again, it resumes to send via amqp
